We used 2 datasets from the public platform Kaggle. Amidst the pandemic many people lost their jobs, with this ETL project, As fellow data scientists weâ€™re looking to help job searchers find their qualifying positions through listings such as salary, company, location, and ratings.

This dataset contains many job listings for data scientist positions, with features such as: 
Salary Estimate
Location
Company Rating
Job Description

# The Sources of our DataSet is as follows 
DataScientist.csv  - https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/data-scientist-jobs 

alldata.csv - https://www.kaggle.com/sl6149/data-scientist-job-market-in-the-us

# Research Questions 
What is the salary range of a Data Scientist in a particular location?

Relationship between Salary and Company rating?

What is the impact of the data set used with the market requirements?

The objective of this part is to define the problem statement of this data to figure out what are the factors the researchers go for (employers , recruiters or employees)?
